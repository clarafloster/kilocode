## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Autonomous Inner Loop Pattern
Kilocode implements a sophisticated "inner loop" execution pattern that enables AI agents to:

1. **Receive and interpret** user tasks autonomously
2. **Break down complex tasks** into actionable steps
3. **Execute steps using available tools** without constant human intervention
4. **Monitor progress and adapt** when encountering obstacles
5. **Validate completion** and report results

### Key Components

#### üéØ Mode System
- **Code Mode**: General-purpose development tasks
- **Architect Mode**: Planning and design-focused operations
- **Debug Mode**: Systematic problem diagnosis and resolution
- **Ask Mode**: Information gathering and question answering
- **Orchestrator Mode**: Complex workflow coordination

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tool System
Comprehensive tool integration enabling:
- **File Operations**: Reading, writing, and modifying files
- **Code Analysis**: Understanding and navigating codebases
- **Command Execution**: Running terminal commands and scripts
- **Web Automation**: Browser-based research and interaction
- **MCP Integration**: Extensible capabilities through external servers

#### üîÑ Feedback Mechanisms
- **Consecutive Mistake Detection**: Prevents infinite loops
- **Tool Repetition Detection**: Identifies and breaks repetitive patterns
- **Validation Systems**: Ensures code quality and functionality
- **User Approval Gates**: Maintains human oversight for critical operations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```typescript
// Create a new autonomous task
const task = new Task({
    context,
    provider,
    apiConfiguration,
    task: "Create a REST API for user management with CRUD operations",
    startTask: true
})

// The agent will autonomously:
// 1. Analyze the request
// 2. Plan the implementation
// 3. Create necessary files
// 4. Implement functionality
// 5. Add tests and validation
// 6. Report completion
```

### Mode-Specific Operations
```typescript
// Architecture planning
const architectTask = new Task({
    // ... configuration
    task: "Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform",
    mode: "architect"
})

// Debugging workflow
const debugTask = new Task({
    // ... configuration
    task: "Debug and fix the failing tests in the user authentication module",
    mode: "debug"
})
```

## üîß Configuration

### Tool Groups and Permissions
```typescript
// Configure mode-specific tool access
const customMode: ModeConfig = {
    slug: "security-audit",
    name: "Security Audit",
    roleDefinition: "Security-focused code analysis specialist",
    groups: ["read", "browser"], // Restricted to read-only and research tools
    customInstructions: "Focus on identifying security vulnerabilities..."
}
```

### MCP Server Integration
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "git": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git", "--repository", "."]
        },
        "filesystem": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/workspace"]
        }
    }
}
```

## üîç Key Concepts

### Inner Loop Execution
The framework's core innovation is its ability to operate in autonomous "inner loops" where the AI agent:
- Maintains context across multiple tool executions
- Makes intelligent decisions about next steps
- Recovers from errors and adapts strategies
- Validates progress and completion criteria

### Tool-Driven Architecture
All agent capabilities are exposed through a unified tool system that:
- Provides consistent interfaces for different operations
- Enables fine-grained permission control
- Supports dynamic capability extension through MCP
- Maintains audit trails for all operations

### Mode-Based Specialization
Different operational modes optimize agent behavior for specific scenarios:
- **Specialized Prompting**: Mode-specific system prompts and instructions
- **Tool Restrictions**: Appropriate tool access for each mode's purpose
- **Behavioral Optimization**: Tailored decision-making patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Mode-appropriate interpretation of user requests
